# pands-problem-sheet 
## Overview
This repository was created for the Programming and Scripting module of the ATU Mayo Galway 'Higher Diploma in Computer Programming and Data Analytics' course. It contains a series of weekly tasks and their corresponding solutions, including descriptions of the code solutions and references to the materials used during the process of creating them.

## Weekly Tasks
#### Task 1 - Hello World
Task 1: Create a file that contains a Python program which displays **Hello World!** when executed. A file named 'helloworld.py' was created to perform this task. The program successfully displays **Hello World!** when executed.

#### Task 2 - Bank
Task 2: Create a file that contains a Python program which displays the answer to a calculation in a format with a euro sign and a decimal point between the euro and cent. The program prompts the user to enter two different amounts in cents, adds them together, and then displays the answer in a human-readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the calculated amount. A file named 'pythonbank.py' was created to work on solutions for this task. The program 'pythonbank.py' successfully displays the answer in the correct format of euro and cents.

#### Task 3 - Accounts
Task 3: Create a Python program called 'accounts.py' that reads in a 10-character account number and outputs the account number where only the last 4 digits are shown and the first 6 digits are replaced with X. The program obtains input from the user in the form of a 10-digit account number and, after some manipulation, outputs the number where only the first 4 digits are visible and the remaining 6 digits are replaced with X. A file named 'pythonbank.py' was created to work on solutions for this task. When run, the program successfully outputs the number where only the first 4 digits are visible and the remaining 6 digits are replaced with X.

#### Task 3a - Accounts Modified
Task 3a: Modify the third task's program to read in a bank account number of any length. The program should display the last 4 digits of the account number (where account numbers are greater than 4 digits in length) and replace the numbers before those with X. If the input account number is less than 4 digits long, the program should print out the message 'Invalid account number. Please enter a valid account number.' A file named 'accounts_extra.py' was created to work on solutions for this task. When run, the program successfully prints out the account number where the last 4 digits are displayed and the digits before that are replaced with X. When the input account number is shorter than 4 digits, the program prints out the message 'Invalid account number. Please enter a valid account number.

#### Task 4 - Collatz
Task 4: Create a Python program called 'collatz.py' that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation: at each step, it calculates the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, dividing it by two, but if it is odd, multiplying it by three and adding one. The program ends if the current value is one. A file named 'collatz.py' was created to work on solutions for this task. When run, the program successfully prints out the desired outcome.

#### Task 5 - Weekday
Task 5 - Create a Python program named 'weekday.py' that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. The 'weekday.py' file was created to work on solutions for this task. When run, the program has two types of output depending on the day it is run. If the current day is a weekday, it outputs 'Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.' If the current day is a weekend day, it outputs 'It is a weekend, yay.' The program was tested on both weekdays and weekend days, and on both occasions, the program successfully outputs the desired outcome.

#### Task 6 - Squareroot
Task 6: Create a Python program named 'squareroot.py' that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root without using the built-in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x). The 'squareroot.py' file was created to work on solutions for this task. When run, the program takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.

#### Task 7 - Count of the letter e in the text file
Task 7: Write a Python program named 'es.py' that reads in a text file and outputs the number of 'e's it contains. The program takes the filename as an argument on the command line. Additionally, a small text file named 'data.txt' was created for testing purposes. The contents of the file can be found at https://the-big-bang-theory.com/soft_kitty/. When the program is run, it reads in the file and outputs the number of 'e's it contains.

#### Task 8 - Histogram
Task 8: Write a Python program named 'plottask.py' that displays a histogram of a normal distribution of 1000 values with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2, and a plot of the function h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 10] on the same set of axes. The program should generate a pop-up window that displays both the histogram and the plot. A file named 'plottask.py' has been created to work on solutions for this task. When you run the program, it will display the histogram and the plot as described above.
