# pands-problem-sheet 
## Overview
This repository was created for the Programming and Scripting module on the ATU Mayo Galway 'H Dip in Computer Programming and Data Analytics' course. This repository consists of a siries of weekly tasks and solutions. It gives a description of the code solutions and referenses the material that was used in the process of creating the solution for the weekly tasks.

## Weekly Tasks
#### Task 1 - Hello World
Task 1: create a file that contains a python program that displays **Hello World!** when it is run. A file named helloworld.py was created to perfom the task. The program successfully displays **Hello World!** when it is run.

#### Task 2 - Bank
Task 2: create a file that contains a python program that displays the answer to a callculation in a format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent. 
The program prompts the user to enter two different amouns in cents. Then adds two amounts togetherand reads in two money amounts (in cent). Then it displays the answer to the task in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the calculated amount.A file named pythonbank.py was created to work on sullutions to the task. The program pythonbank.py succesfully displays an answer in the correct form of euro and cents.

#### Task 3 - Accounts
Task 3: create a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number where only the last 4 digits are showing and the first 6 digits are replaced with X. Prodram gets output from the user in a form of 10 digits account number and after some manipulation outputs the number where only first 4 numbers are visible and the remaining 6 numbers are replased with X. A file named pythonbank.py was created to work on sullutions to the task. When run, the program outputs the number where only first 4 numbers are visible and the remaining 6 numbers are replased with X.

#### Task 4 - Collatz
Task 4: create a program, called collatz.py, that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step it calculates the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divides it by two, but if it is odd, multiplies it by three and adds one. The program ends if the current value is one.

#### Task 5 - Weekday
Task 5 - create a program, named weekday.py, that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. The weekday.py program was created. When run the program has two types of output. If the current day is weekday it outputs 'Yes, unfortinately today is a weekday.' If the current day is a weekend day it outputs 'It is a weekend, yay.' The program was tested on both week day and weekend day. On both occasions program outputs desired outcome.

#### Task 7 - Count of the letter e in the text file
Task 7: write a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of 'e's it contains. The program takes the filename from an argument on the command line.  The program reads through the text file and counts all instances of 'e', both capital and low case.
